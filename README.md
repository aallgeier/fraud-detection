# ECE 6254: Statistical Machine Learning Group Project

## Project Summary (from Final Report)
The problem of credit card fraud detection gives us a unique opportunity to analyze a highly skewed real-world dataset. We accomplished an extensive pre-processing of the data including resampling and dimensionality reduction, and applied supervised learning for detecting fraudulent transactions. We performed a comparative analysis of the performance of machine learning methods including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, kNN, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets, and Support Vector Machines. The “winner” among these algorithms based on accuracy, precision, recall and the f1-score is described in detail in subsequent sections.
